User Research Insights
Research Methods:

Surveys:
We conducted surveys with nine users who have low to medium computer literacy to gather quantitative data on their experiences and challenges. The survey results revealed the following insights:
Ease of Use: 67% of respondents found the current upload process confusing, indicating a need for clearer instructions and guidance.
File Format Preferences: 78% preferred uploading files in common formats like CSV and PDF, while 22% expressed a desire for support for less common formats like XML.
Time Spent: On average, users reported spending 15 minutes to upload files, with 44% stating that they often encountered errors during the process.

Interviews:
One-on-one interviews were conducted to gain qualitative insights into user behaviors and preferences regarding uploading and downloading data. Key findings from the interviews included:
Pain Points: Users frequently mentioned frustration with the lack of feedback during uploads, stating they were unsure if their files were being processed correctly.
Desired Features: Many users expressed a desire for a drag-and-drop feature, as they found it more intuitive than traditional file selection methods.
Support Needs: Interviewees indicated a need for more accessible help resources, such as video tutorials or step-by-step guides, to assist them in navigating the platform.

Usability Testing:
Usability testing sessions were facilitated where participants completed tasks while we observed their interactions with the interface. The results highlighted several areas for improvement:
Task Completion Rate: Participants successfully completed the upload task 60% of the time on their first attempt, with common errors including selecting incorrect file types and not following prompts.
Time on Task: The average time taken to complete the upload task was 12 minutes, with some users struggling significantly due to unclear instructions.
User Satisfaction: Post-task surveys indicated that only 50% of participants felt satisfied with their experience, citing confusion and frustration as major factors.
